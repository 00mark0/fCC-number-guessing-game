# Number Guessing Game

This project is a number guessing game where users try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 1000. The game keeps track of user statistics, including the number of games played and the best game (fewest guesses). User data is stored in a PostgreSQL database. The script interacts with the database to retrieve and update user information.
